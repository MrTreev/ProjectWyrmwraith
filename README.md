# ProjectWyrmwraith
Project Wyrmwraith is made primarily for players of the Pathfinder RPG system who would like a simpler way to complete Pathfinder character sheets.
Project Wyrmwraith is a Player Character Generator that is compatible with PCGen.
Unlike PCGen this program is built in Python but eventually will be rewritten in C or C++
